            <p>Super Mario World is often considered one of the best games in the series
                and is cited as one of the greatest video games ever made. It sold more
                than twenty million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling SNES game. It also led to an animated
                television series of the same name and a 1995 sequel, Yoshi's Island.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">Zelda Tears of Kingdom</h2>
            <p>Tears of the Kingdom received acclaim. Critics praised the expanded world,
                new powers, scale, and story; criticism focused on its voice acting and
                technical performance. It sold more than 10 million copies in its first three days of
                release and over 20.61 million copies by March 2024,
                making it one of the best-selling games on the Nintendo Switch.</p>
